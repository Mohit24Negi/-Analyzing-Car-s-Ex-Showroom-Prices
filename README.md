## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed price distribution and key numerical features
- Identified skewness and presence of outliers
- Studied frequency distribution of categorical variables

### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis
- Fuel Type vs Price
- Body Type vs Price
- Engine Specifications vs Price
- Safety & Comfort Features vs Price

### 🔹 Correlation Analysis
- Identified strong relationships between engine performance features and price
- Observed weak or inverse relationships between mileage and price

---

## ⭐ Key Insights
- Engine performance and body type strongly influence car pricing  
- SUVs dominate higher price ranges  
- Safety and comfort features are more common in premium vehicles  
- Mileage-focused cars typically fall in the budget to mid-range segment  

---

## 💼 Business Insights
- Manufacturers can optimize pricing by aligning features with target segments  
- Customers can make informed decisions by comparing feature-to-price value  
- Dealers can segment inventory based on price-driving attributes  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset reflects static pricing and does not include market fluctuations  
- Regional price variations are not considered  
- Customer demand and brand perception are not quantified  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Exploratory Data Analysis** can uncover valuable insights from raw automotive data.  
Without building predictive models, the analysis highlights key factors influencing car pricing and supports data-driven decision-making.
